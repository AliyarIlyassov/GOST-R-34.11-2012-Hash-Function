# GOST-R-34.11-2012-Hash-Function

   The Russian Federal standard hash function (GOST R 34.11-2012)
   establishes the hash-function algorithm and the hash-function
   calculation procedure for any sequence of binary symbols used in
   cryptographic methods of information processing and information
   security, including techniques for providing data integrity and
   authenticity and for digital signatures during information transfer,
   information processing, and information storage in computer-aided
   systems.
   
   The hash function defined in the standard provides for the operation
   of digital signature systems using the asymmetric cryptographic
   algorithm in compliance with GOST R 34.10-2012 [GOST3410-2012].
   GOST R 34.11-2012 applies to the creation, operation, and
   modernization of information systems of different purpose.

   GOST R 34.11-94 is superseded by GOST R 34.11-2012 from 1st January
   2013.  That means that all new systems that are presented for
   certification MUST use GOST R 34.11-2012 and MAY use GOST R 34.11-94
   also for maintaining compatibility with existing systems.  Usage of
   GOST R 34.11-94 in current systems is allowed at least for a 5-year
   period.
